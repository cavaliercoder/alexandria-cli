# Alexandria CMDB CLI

*A CMDB from the future!!!*

[Alexandria CMDB](https://github.com/cavaliercoder/alexandria) is an open source configuration management database written in [Google Go](https://golang.org/) with a [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) backend.

This project aims to create a fast and powerful CLI to administer Alexandria CMDB via the RESTful API.
